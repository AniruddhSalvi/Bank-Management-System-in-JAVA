# Bank-Management-System-in-JAVA
In the project nesting of do-while loops with the switch case statement is used. Array object is created of the class so that multiple accounts can be opened in each of the indexes of the array.
The 6-digit account numbers are automatically generated with the help of Math.random() method which is then assigned to that particular index to ease the searching process of the account holders.
In every case of the switch statement PIN and account number are taken from the user so that privacy of the details can be maintained and no one can access the account holder's details with PIN and the account number.
Custom Exception Handling is used in the program if the PIN entered is incorrect. Exception in the withdrawal function is also made so that withdrawal of the large amount is not made w.r.t available balance of the account.
If the balance is less than the amount to be withdrawn the Error is generated which causes the withdrawal process's termination due to not sufficient balance.
From this idea many different management projects can be created so feel free to go through it and explore the other aspects of it.

May the code be helpful to you in your college projects or for your brainstorming.
